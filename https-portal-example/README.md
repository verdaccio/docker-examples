# Verdaccio and https-portal Example

Run `verdaccio` under fully automated HTTPS server powered by Nginx, Let's Encrypt  was never so easy. Using [https-portal](https://github.com/SteveLTN/https-portal) all is builtin and no need to extra configuration.

## Prerequisites

In order to make it works, this is just a local setup, so you must update your `host` file.

On Mac

```
âžœ sudo vi /etc/hosts  

##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.0.1       example.com
```


## Usage

To run the containers, run the following in this folder, it should starts the containers in dettach mode.

```bash
 docker-compose up -d
``` 

To recreate the nginx image you can force the build.

```bash
 docker-compose up --build -d
``` 

To force recreate the images.

```bash
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate  -d
```

To stop all containers

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

```
